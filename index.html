        <h1>Hello today i am going to talk about my favourite hobby and passion, gaming</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>I love gaming because it is entertaining and I am sure you will not agree with the next thing I say but i also think that gaming can be good for you if you play it in good amounts and play games recommended ages. I think that gaming has slightly increased my attention to detail and my hand-eye coordination. That is the best part about why i like gaming. It is so much fun I play many games with my friends and it is so good that evenwhen we are so far away we can play together somewhat like old times. </p>
